Notes

The project was very interesting and enjoyable to work on.

Issues Faced

• The biggest challenge was that the developer.marvel.com documentation was frequently unresponsive, so I had to rely on third-party sources to find the necessary API information

• Initially, I didn’t realize there was a provided design for the entire application. I styled the app with my own dark theme first. Once I discovered the design, I restyled the application to match it. This turned out to be an interesting task, and I decided to implement a light/dark mode toggle to keep both styles available.

• When I was implementing the Infinite Scroll feature I was in doubt if I should use the already existing React libraries for it but didn't want to give an impression of laziness and on the other side didn't want to build the custom InfinteScroll and give an impression of not knowing the possibilites to use libraries so I decided to keep both versions where custom made infinte scroll is commented in ComicsPage.tsx & ComicsPage.module.css so when you plan to test it take a look at both versions.

Unimplemented Requirements
• All project requirements have been implemented.
